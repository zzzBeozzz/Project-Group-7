This report delves into the world of YouTube advertisements, offering a comprehensive analysis of linguistic and persuasive techniques utilized across various digital campaigns. By examining a curated dataset of short advertisements, we aim to decode the elements that make digital marketing efforts successful in today's competitive landscape.

Descriptive Data: The primary dataset for this study consists of 50 YouTube short advertisements, ranging in duration from 20 to 40 seconds. These advertisements span a period from 1986 to 2024, providing a broad temporal landscape to analyze changes and trends in advertising strategies. The advertisements are in English and Cantonese, reflecting a dual-language approach that caters to diverse demographic segments. Each advertisement has been transcribed, segmented, and annotated with detailed metadata that includes language, engagement levels, type of humor, emotional appeals, and the presence of cultural or social references.

# Discussion 

## Findings

Based on the observations, the linguistic and persuasive strategies used in modern digital advertising often leverage specific elements to captivate and engage the audience. 

The use of dramatic-style background music in many advertisements suggests a strategic attempt to evoke emotions and heighten the viewer's engagement with the content. Humorous advertisements, such as the one from Doritos, resonate particularly well with audiences, indicating that the strategic use of humor can be an effective persuasive tool.

Furthermore, the analysis suggests that dialogues incorporating exclamations are more commonly used, potentially to convey a sense of excitement or urgency. Conversely, advertisements without a clear narrative structure or dialogue appear to be less popular, emphasizing the importance of storytelling and engaging language in modern digital advertising, a good example of this could be seen from the KFC with Jack Harlow, the video has many exclamation, exaggerating the feelings, the delivery of messages attracts customers. 
The prevalence of techniques like exclamations, irony, and special effects in highly viewed advertisements, such as those from Apple, conveying irony to other products that cannot pay accordingly, comments are filled with peals of laughter and the views of the video are quite high as seen from the raw file of YouTube lists, Keung To for Coke Zero uses many special effects and strong use of words, highlighting the word of choice affects the views. This further highlights the significance of these linguistic and visual elements in capturing the audience's attention and shaping their perceptions. These findings suggest that brands actively leverage a combination of linguistic, auditory, and visual strategies to create captivating and persuasive digital advertising experiences.
