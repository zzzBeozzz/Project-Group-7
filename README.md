## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving domain of digital marketing, understanding the nuances of advertisement strategies is crucial for brands aiming to capture and sustain consumer attention. This report delves into the world of YouTube advertisements, offering a comprehensive analysis of linguistic and persuasive techniques utilized across various digital campaigns. By examining a curated dataset of short advertisements, we aim to decode the elements that make digital marketing efforts successful in today's competitive landscape.

These advertisements span a period from 1986 to 2024, providing a broad temporal landscape to analyze changes and trends in advertising strategies. The advertisements are in English and Cantonese, reflecting a dual-language approach that caters to diverse demographic segments. Each advertisement has been transcribed, segmented, and annotated with detailed metadata that includes language, engagement levels, type of humor, emotional appeals, and the presence of cultural or social references.

# Discussion 

## Findings

Based on the observations, the linguistic and persuasive strategies used in modern digital advertising often leverage specific elements to captivate and engage the audience. 

The use of dramatic-style background music in many advertisements suggests a strategic attempt to evoke emotions and heighten the viewer's engagement with the content. Humorous advertisements, such as the one from Doritos, resonate particularly well with audiences, indicating that the strategic use of humor can be an effective persuasive tool.

Furthermore, the analysis suggests that dialogues incorporating exclamations are more commonly used, potentially to convey a sense of excitement or urgency. Conversely, advertisements without a clear narrative structure or dialogue appear to be less popular, emphasizing the importance of storytelling and engaging language in modern digital advertising, a good example of this could be seen from the [KFC with Jack Harlow](Ali.annotation3.txt "KFC with Jack Harlow"), the video has many exclamation, exaggerating the feelings, the delivery of messages attracts customers. 

The prevalence of techniques like exclamations, irony, and special effects in highly viewed advertisements, such as those from [Apple](Ali.annotation1.txt "Apple"), conveying irony to other products that cannot pay accordingly, comments are filled with peals of laughter and the views of the video are quite high as seen from the raw file of YouTube lists, Keung To for Coke Zero uses many special effects and strong use of words, highlighting the word of choice affects the views. This further highlights the significance of these linguistic and visual elements in capturing the audience's attention and shaping their perceptions. These findings suggest that brands actively leverage a combination of linguistic, auditory, and visual strategies to create captivating and persuasive digital advertising experiences.

## Difficulties and Limitations 


There are several factors that affects the results comes from the YouTube videos. The obvious problems are regarding the YouTube system. From YouTube, the channel that upload the advertisement could be confusing as we do not know whether it is from the verified channel or just a random uploader. This may disturb the view of the advertisement as if the video was upload by a random person, the views are significantly lower compared to official channel. Other factor is the upload date. The YouTube videos we did data cleaning on, we removed the date from the list as the date is irrelevant to annotation, yet the date greatly affects the views and delivery method of the advertisement, old advertisement videos often does not have a great use of special effects or strong camera movements and are quite weak on editing compared to latest advertisements. These videos could hardly reach audiences since it is old, that maybe most audience who viewed the advertisement are through television. As a result, finding advertisement like that was a hassle. 

The genre, brand and the style also affect the advertisements results, leading to data bias. Some advertisers struggle to always use humorous ways to promote their products since the product or message are government-related or are serious topics, these advertisement style and word of choice may not appeal to customers and cause the views to be lessen. While doing data collection, struggling to find variety of advertisement are a problem due to this reason, that for majority of advertisement we found are very hyped, funny and relaxing, the ones are soothing and serious tones are hardly found and do not fit the ratio. This leads to data bias as the data lean to more products selling using funny stories or a humorous delivery or narrative, limiting our availability of advertisement choices. 
Lastly, there are technical issues we faced while doing data collection and annotations. For the data collection part, as mentioned above, variety of the YouTube advertisements are undermined, there are also technical problems such as the pop-up advertisement we clicked on does not follow up to the video or it leads to a wrong website for some reason, this causes the data to be unclear, giving up and have to choose another videos. Moreover, we had to use other videos from television or VPN since the YouTube advertisement keep showing same or similar advertisement, for once we widen our advertisement choices, yet limited the same region advertisement collection, leading to different data collection from different region, causing data inaccuracies. 

Lastly, while doing data annotations, we struggle to use AI tools such as text-to-speech function or Merlin AI, a YouTube video transcript tool, since the inaccuracy rate was quite high, leading us use to type the advertisement manually which is much more time consuming and tiring. Similarly, some videos provided transcript however the accuracy is doubtable, also the timestamps of the videos are often wrongly indicated, so we decided to manually type the time frame as well. 

## Further Studies and Improvements 

An increase in diversity is needed by including advertisements from a wider range aspects, such as more government related, airline services and so on, to further analysis the word of choice, the professionalism in their videos.  

It is also important to view the incorporate analysis of visual elements in addition to linguistic aspects, in annotations and our data cleaning and data segmentation, we left out or analysis less on the visual aspects, so that definitely need to be seen at and do more research on, to see how it contributes to YouTube advertisement.  

The data files and raw files serves as a track and analyse changes in advertising strategies over time, to indicate whether advertisement style is going to change or see more similarity aspects that most advertisement uses overtime. 

To increase our efficiency and better on transcription, the urge to explore the use of machine learning models to automate processes are highly anticipated, search for better tools to acquire latest advertisements and tools to transcript YouTube advertisement more accurately. 

## Conclusion 

In conclusion, the advertisements provide insights into modern digital advertising strategies, showing effective message delivery in a limited duration. Analyzing the linguistic features and persuasive elements used, not only indicates how word of choice and means to convey messages affect appeals, but also contributes to understanding the evolving advertising landscape. The advertisement indicates the effectiveness and meaning of linguistics, showing the importance of what could be appealing and attract people to view, thus providing an insight into what nowadays digital realm creators are currently utilizing to make successful videos, whether it is superb linguistic features or stunning visual effects, it is worth taking a deep dive into.
